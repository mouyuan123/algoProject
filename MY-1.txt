The employment-to-population ratio which indicates the ability of an economy to create employment rose by 0.1 percentage point to 66.2 per cent in January 2022 as compared to 66.1 per cent in the previous month. 
 

By economic sector, the number of employed persons in Services persistently recorded a month-on-month increase particularly in Food & beverages services, Wholesale & retail trade; and Information & communication activities. Similar trend was observed in Manufacturing and Construction sectors with the number of employment remained increasing.

Likewise, the own-account workers category continued to increase by registering 2.66 million persons (+0.6% or +16.0 thousand persons) in January 2022 (December 2021: 2.64 million persons).

Therefore, the January’s labour force participation rate (LFPR) increased to 69.1 per cent (December 2021: 69.0%). 
 

The number of outside labour force in January 2022 reduced further to 7.33 million persons with a lessening of 5.6 thousand persons or 0.1 per cent (December 2021: 7.34 million persons).

A healthier economic outlook is anticipated in the months ahead reflecting by the Leading Index which continuously above 100.0 points and rising in December 2021. This positive outlook will lead to the increase in the business’ activities, thus creating more labour demand in the economy. With more job opportunities created, will encourage more labour participation, hence fostering the labour market to be more vibrant in the forthcoming months.
 
LABOUR FORCE SITUATION CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN JANUARY 2022 LED BY THE RISE IN EMPLOYMENT WHILE UNEMPLOYED PERSONS TRENDED DOWN

An encouraging economic activity was observed in January 2022 since all states being in Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (NRP) including Kelantan and Sarawak which took effect from 3 January 2022. This situation has allowed businesses to continue operating at full capacity with longer business hours. During the month, the vaccination rate of Malaysian population has increased plus majority of the population has received the booster dose. As of 30 January 2022, 50.8 per cent of the adults has received the COVID-19 booster dose while 97.9 per cent of the adults has completed two-dose of the vaccination.

Similar trend was also observed on the year-on-year comparison with a significant increase in the labour force. Meanwhile, the Leading Index (LI) continuously above 100.0 points and rising in December 2021 indicates a more sanguine momentum on the economic outlook in the months ahead (November 2021: 111.3 points) despite the surge in COVID-19 cases.

With more job opportunities created, will encourage more labour participation, hence fostering the labour market to be more vibrant in the forthcoming months. 

Following the current health situation which witnessed the new daily cases is on an increasing trend, it may give some challenges to the labour market.

TECHNICAL NOTES

This information is derived from the  Labour Force Survey (LFS) which was conducted to collect information on the structure and distribution of labour force, employment and unemployment.

Concepts and definitions used in LFS are based on the standard guidelines of International Labour Organizations (ILO) through “Manual on Concepts and Methods: Surveys of Economically Active Population, Employment, Unemployment and Underemployment” which is also used by other country.
 
LFS covers both urban and rural areas of all states in Malaysia through personal interview method.
The survey population cover persons who live in private living quarters and excludes persons residing in institutions such as hotels, hostels, hospitals, prisons, boarding houses and workers residing in construction work site.

The survey comprises of the economically active and inactive population. To measure the economically active population, the LFS uses the age limit of 15 to 64 years. The economically active population comprises of those employed and unemployed whereas those who are inactive is classified as outside the labour force.

LFS uses the actual status approach, where a person is classified on the basis of his labour force activity during the reference week.

Labour force refers to those who, during the reference week are in the 15 to 64 years (in completed years at last birthday) and who are either employed or unemployed.
Employed refers to all persons who, at any time during the reference week worked at least one hour for pay, profit or family gain (as an employer, employee, own-account worker or unpaid family worker). Also considered as employed are persons who did not work during the reference week because of illness, injury, bad weather, leave, labour dispute and social or religious reasons but had a job, farm, enterprise or other family enterprise to return to.  Also included are those on temporary lay-off with pay who would definitely be called back to work.
Unemployed
Unemployed refers to those who do not have a job but are interested to work. There are two groups of unemployed that is the actively unemployed and inactively unemployed.

Outside Labour Force
All persons not classified as employed or unemployed as stated above are classified as outside labour force. Includes housewives, students (including those going for further studies), retired, disabled persons and those not interested in looking for a job.

Labour Force Participation Rate
The economic activity of a population depends on the demographic characteristics of that population. The proportion of economically active population, therefore, differs between sub-groups of that population. These variations are measured by specific activity rates termed as labour force participation rate. Labour force participation rate is defined as the ratio of the labour force to the working age population (15 to 64 years), expressed as percentage.

Unemployment rate is the proportion of unemployed population to the total population in labour force. This rate measures the percentage of unemployed population in the labour force. 
 
Seasonally adjusted
 
Malaysian economic time series data are affected by major religious festivals such as the Eid-ul Fitr, the Chinese New Year and the Deepavali. The major festivals in this country are usually related to the religious activities and such as, the dates are determined by the respective religious calendar. The dates of these holidays are not in line with the Gregorian calendar. Hence, they tend to move along the Gregorian calendar and has strong seasonal influence on many economic time series data.
 
Since these non-fixed holidays have large impact on the time series data, they need to be taken into account when performing seasonal adjustment process so as to avoid confusion in seasonally adjusted data and trend estimates. Furthermore, the presence of the non-fixed holidays effects may complicate the interpretation of the data.
 
Seasonal adjustment is a process of removing the estimated effects of normal seasonal variation from the original series so that the effects of other influences on the series may be more clearly recognized.
 
Seasonal adjustment can be derived by various methods and the results may vary according to the procedure adopted. The approach used for seasonal adjustment in Malaysia is the  Seasonal Adjustment for Malaysia (SEAM).
 
SEAM is a procedure to remove moving holiday effect on the selected Malaysian economic time series data by introducing steps that can be used to overcome the limitations of the existing seasonal adjustment procedure. To apply the SEAM procedure, the X-ARIMA program in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) is used.
 
This seasonal adjusted rate will be revised when a complete 12 months time series for the particular year are obtained.
 
Population Benchmarks
Population by characteristics of age group, ethnicity and state were used as benchmarks to produce labour statistics.

Starting with the monthly release of the Principal Statistics of Labour Force, Malaysia, January 2016, the principal statistics of labour is estimated based on the current population estimates as compared to the previous series which used population projections based on the Population and Housing Census of Malaysia, 2010. This rebase is to obtain statistics that is more consistent with current population structure.
